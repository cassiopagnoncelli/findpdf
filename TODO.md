Find the distribution of a given set.

Idea:

1. Extend the dataset with bootstrap if it is too small
2. Classify the data (eg. real or nonnegative or positive, integer or continuous
3. Find the best parameters for each distribution
4. List the distributions with the best fitting ranked by the most likely distributions

TODO

1. include parameters restrictions in rmse, eg. a < b in runif.
2. solve the warnings().
